## DATA ANALYSIS STEP

#### Data collection
This report analyzes data on air crashes from 1908 to 2023. the data was source from Kaggle. The data was imported into excel by opening the csv file.

#### Data cleaning
Upon loading the data an initial inspection was performed to identify missing values in column like country/region, operator and so on using filter, check for duplicate and replacing missing values and blank row with unknown. All dates and numeric values are formatted correctly, calculated column was added to know the amount of people that survived the air crashes.


 
#### Pivot Table
Pivot table is used to summarization, exploration, and visualization the crashes by the aircraft type, sum of fatalities, average fatalities.  
 
#### Dashboard
Dashboard is used to present data in a graphical format that is easy to understand and interpret like bar chart.

 ## KEY FINDINGS
 
#### TOP 10 LOCATION ASSOCIATED WITH AIRCRASHES
The analysis shows that the top 10 location associated with air crashes is Moscow Russia with 16 incidents follow by New York New and Manilla Philippine with 15 incidents follow by Cairo Egypt and Sao Paulo Brazil with 13 incidents follow by Rio de Janeiro Brazil and Botargo Colombia with 12 incidents follow by Chicago Illinois and Near Moscow Russia with 11 incidents and Tehran Iran with 10 incidents these might be because some of this location are near mountains, dense urban areas with adverse weather conditions and outdated infrastructures or insufficient safety measures.

#### THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF FATALITIES PER CRASH OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS
The analysis shows that the overall average number of fatalities per crash over the last 20 years is 24.48. this shows an average on each air crashes results in approximately 24.48 fatalities. The average number of fatalities per crash have been stabilized around 20.65-31.5 with notable fluctuation. The average fatalities were high in 2014 and low in 2017 certain years like 2016, 2018,2020 and 2023 with higher averages may require further investigation into specific incident or contributing factors. 

#### COUNTRY WITH HIGHEST NUMBER OF AIRCRASHES
The country with the highest number of air crashes is Russia with a total of 249 air crashes. This might be due to large geographical areas, adverse weather condition and high volume of traffics in the country.

#### MONTH AIRCRASHES OCCUR THE MOST IN RUSSIA
The month with the highest number of air crashes is December with 33 number of air crashes. These might be due to winter conditions and limited light day during the winter months might can affect flight operations and safety. There might be increase in air traffic in December these might be due to holiday travels leading to high probability of air crashes.

#### AIRCRASHES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TOP 10 AIR MANUFACTURER
The top aircraft manufacturer with the highest number of air crashes is Douglas with 993 number of air crashes follow by Boeing and Antonov with 387 and 287 number of air crashes. these might be due to the long operational history of Douglas aircraft which were widely used in the mid-20th century. Some of these manufacturers have been producing aircraft for many decades contributing to their high number of crashes due to the large number of aircraft in operation over a long period.  Older aircraft models particularly from the earlier years of aviation had higher crash rates compared to modern aircraft.

#### THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT SURVIVED THE AIRCRASHES IN THE LAST 20 YEARS
There is fluctuation in the number of survivors each year with some year higher than the other. The analysis shows that 2005 has the highest number of survivors with 857 these might be due to several incidents with successful emergency responses and effective safety measures.

#### THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT DIED IN AIRCRASHES IN THE LAST 20 YEARS
There is fluctuation in the number of fatalities each year with some year higher than the other. The year 2005 shows the highest number of fatalities with 1294 incident indicating that while there were crashes with high survival rates, there were also multiple incidents with significant loss of life. A thorough investigation is necessary to understand the reasons behind the crashes.

#### AIRCRASHES ASSOCIATED WITH TOP 10 OPERATORS
The operator with the highest number of air crashes is unknown, Aeroflot and force Air US military with 234, 188 and 92 number of air crashes. Unknown operators having the highest number of crashes these might be due to lack of proper documentation.  Aeroflot is one of the major Russian airlines with high number of crashes these might be could be due to the airline's long operational history, the high volume of flights, and historical safety practices during certain periods of the airline's history.

#### THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF GROUND PER CRASH OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS
The steady average of ground fatalities per crash suggests that there have been no significant changes in the severity of crashes in terms of ground impact over the past 20 years. The consistent ground fatalities per crash underscore the need for enhanced ground safety measures, especially in areas surrounding and crash-prone zones.
